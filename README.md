# D3-Challenge
Data Journalism and D3<br>

Analyze the current trends shaping people's lives.<br>
Create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.<br>
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics.<br>
Sniff out the first story idea and sift through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.<br>
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates:<br> https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.<br>
The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."<br>

Level 1: D3 Dabbler<br>

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.<br>
Create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.<br>
Code this graphic in the app.js file and pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. <br>
Include state abbreviations in the circles.<br>
Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.<br>


Note: Use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in the web browser.<br>




Level 2: Optional Challenge<br>

1. More Data, More Dynamics<br>
Include more demographics and more risk factors. <br>
Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data to display. <br>
Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. <br>
Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.<br>

Hint: Try binding all of the CSV data to the circles. This will let the graph easily determine their x or y values when you click the labels.<br>


2. Incorporate d3-tip<br>
While the ticks on the axes allow developers to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. <br>
Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. <br>
Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmerâ€”we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory.<br>
